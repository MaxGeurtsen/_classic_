## History/Base
This addon is based on the addon RepHelper, that was initially based on Factionizer.


RepHelper (Retail) on Github: <https://github.com/chawan/RepHelper>  
RepHelper (Classic) on Github: <https://github.com/chawan/RepHelper_Classic>  
RepHelper on Curse: <https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/rephelper>  
Factionizer on Github: <https://github.com/gOOvER/Factionizer>  
Factionizer on Curse: <https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/factionizer>

I appreciate all the work done on these addons.

## Additions/Changes
The main change that was added on top of the existing RepHelper addon is the expansionIndex, this allows the addon to check for each faction exactly what reputaiton value is correct for the current version of the game, and when certain quests were added. This also allows the addon to check till when a certain faction is active.
This also allows the addon to work for each version of the game, since the Blizzard API went through multiple changes through the years.
Further additions were made to Classic/TBC factions/reputations to be more up to date, by adding more quests/dailes and reputation values.

## Reason
The main reason this addon was created was for the release of Wrath of the lich king ClassicÂ as this will break the current classic version of RepHelper that is no longer being updated.
