# GogoLoot

### Don't Let Loot Slow Down Your Zug

A Classic WoW addon to help speed up runs by automating the Master Looter and Group Loot settings.

GogoLoot settings will appear when you are promoted to Master Looter, or you can type ```/gl``` to bring up the settings window.

By default "Auto Loot", "Auto Greed on BoEs", and "Speedy Loot (No Loot Window)" settings are enabled.

GogoLoot integrates with Softres.it! Simply paste in your CSV export from Softres.it and GogoLoot will automatically loot items to the people who it can; when more than one person had a SR on an item, the Master Looter can manually call for a roll on that item.

Stay tuned, there's more to come! (=
