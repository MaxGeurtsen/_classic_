[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-BCC/compare/2.5.35...a8ca274e1c9c9aaea20d94ce40b353e900f3c57b) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-BCC/releases)

- tweak  
- Muru Update  
     - Slight adjustment to human spawn timers to line up better with their spawns  
     - Black hole target is now detectable  
     - Fixed a bug where false add spawn alerts could still fire/start new timers after phase 2 trigger has happened  
     - Tweaks to black hole initial timer (was too long before)  
- Brutallus Update  
     - enabled burn target announce warning, since it now announces BOSSES target only and not spreads.  
     - In addition, if you are the target of the bosses burn, you'll now get a warning that you are target about a full second faster since SUCCESS passes target in classic (when it didn't in original tbc)  
     - Slight timer tweaks (talking .3 seconds here, any timer reports beyond that have been verifeid normal variance and not a DBM issue)  
- Fixes to KJ timers  
- Re update hyjal wave timer localization.kr (#1)  
- Bump alphas
